# EMOJIFY
‘EMOJIFY’ is about emojis or avatars which are ways to indicate nonverbal cues. These cues have become an  essential part of online chatting, product review, brand emotion, and many more. Emojis have become a new language that can more effectively express an idea or emotion leading to increased data science research dedicated to emoji- driven storytelling. With advancements in computer vision and deep learning, it is now possible to detect human emotions from images. Emojify is a deep learning project, we classify human facial expressions to filter and map corresponding emojis or avatars. In Today’s Generation  people usually tend to communicate with each other using emotions so that the other person would understand them better. Although we have many of the smiley emojis , these can be interpreted in more than one way. So, in order to overcome this interpretation we thought of making our own customized emojis which would reflect the user and their emotions in the form of emoji . The project is not intended to solve a real-world problem, instead emojify allows us to see things more colorful in the chatting world. We use a dataset which classifies the emotions shown in the facial expression. The emojify would in turn create more interest among the users as it would be they themselves and their exact emotion reflecting in the form of an emoji.
